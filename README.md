# Universum Theme

After using several themes for Visual Code I was never satisfied until I used [Plastic](https://plastictheme.com/). It's clean simple and helped me a lot to read the code and detect the syntax quickly and consistently. However as I like to customize things in order to hopefully improve our development experience I decided to create this theme taking in consideration not only the syntax but also the editor interface keeping both consistent and very pleasing to the eye.

## Icons

Carefully selected icons with custom colors to match theme in the best way possible. I'm constantly updating them so if you want to add more please request by creating an [issue](https://github.com/dbeff/vscode-theme-universum/issues).
